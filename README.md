# Datalogger

It is a desktop application developed in Qt. This controls communication with an Arduino UNO, which has two sensors connected, making a request 
for data periodically whose value can be configured. This data is stored in a database and can be arranged in different ways. The application can 
be adapted for sensors of all kinds of applications.
